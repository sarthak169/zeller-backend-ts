Zeller Backend Challenge

Steps to Use
 - npm -i
 - npx tsc
 - create your own tsc config file or use the one provided in sample
 - node src/index.js (in case you are using build as the output )
 - Currently i have setup the order in the index.ts file for the input of the items, you can change it there and run npx tsc again before running the build for the modified output
 - Feel free to reach our for any clarification
